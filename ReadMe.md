## Motivation
I had heard about Terraform as a good solution to infrastructure as code approach. I have been using idempotent powershell scripts as a way to achieve that objective. However, as I moved further and further into infrastructure as code process, I started realizing that there should be an efficient way of also provisioning the underlying systems. This repository is to capture my learning using terraform. My objective is to be able to run a few use cases, e.g. how to provision a VM (EC2 instance) in AWS, and a VM in Azure. As I learn more I will add more use cases to this repository.

## Approach
To begin with, most of my hands on learnings are going to be following tutorials/getting started docs available at https://www.terraform.io/ 
Later on I intend of adding my own use cases and using terraform to provision the scenarios

## Prerequistes
Installation is available as part of getting stated documentations at https://www.terraform.io/
